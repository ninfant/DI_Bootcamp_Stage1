          Céline Dion was born on March 30, 1968, in Charlemagne, Quebec, as the
          youngest of 14 siblings in a humble but musically passionate family.
          From a very young age, she displayed her innate talent by singing at
          her parents’ restaurant, and at just 12 years old, she recorded her
          first song, catching the attention of her future manager and husband,
          René Angélil.

          In 1988, Céline won the Eurovision Song Contest representing
          Switzerland, marking the beginning of her international rise. In the
          1990s, she became a global superstar with albums like Falling Into You
          and Let’s Talk About Love, featuring unforgettable hits such as
          Because You Loved Me, The Power of Love, and the legendary My Heart
          Will Go On, the main theme of Titanic.

          charisma on stage, solidifying her status as an icon through her Las
          Vegas residencies, where she performed hundreds of shows over nearly
          two decades. Her career boasts over 200 million records sold, five
          Grammy Awards, two Oscars for musical themes, and a cherished place in
          the hearts of millions of fans worldwide.

          in the face of personal challenges, such as the loss of her husband
          René Angélil in 2016. Despite this, her love for music and connection
          with her fans have kept her performing, serving as a source of
          inspiration and resilience.
